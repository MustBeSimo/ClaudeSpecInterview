## What is SPEC?

The SPEC Workflow is a three-step process that forces clarity before implementation:

1. **Create** — Write a minimal SPEC.md (2–5 paragraphs)
2. **Interview** — Dialogue with Claude Code to refine assumptions
3. **Finalize** — Claude writes the detailed specification

## Why It Matters

Building without a specification is building with hope. Hidden assumptions only reveal themselves during rework.

The SPEC workflow ensures:
- **Precision in intent** before writing code
- **Explicit assumptions** that are challenged early
- **Blueprint clarity** that prevents costly rework

## Getting Started

1. Create a `SPEC.md` file for your next project (minimal draft, 2–5 paragraphs)
2. Share it with Claude Code using the interview prompt from the guide
3. Let the dialogue reveal what you truly need to build

## Philosophy: Public Guide, Private Process

**This repository:** The polished, documented SPEC methodology that anyone can learn from and apply.

**Your process:** Keep your personal notes, iterations, implementation details, and project-specific contexts private.

The guide teaches the pattern. Your specific use cases, learnings, and refinements stay with you—giving you unique advantage while you publicly establish thought leadership on the methodology itself.

**Result:** You share the blueprint everyone can use, while keeping your competitive advantage in how you apply it.

## Time Investment

~30 minutes of structured dialogue. Saves weeks of rework.
