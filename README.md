A structured approach to transform vague ideas into detailed specifications through dialogue with Claude Code.

## What is SPEC?

The SPEC Workflow is a three-step process that forces clarity before implementation:

1. **Create** — Write a minimal SPEC.md (2–5 paragraphs)
2. **Interview** — Dialogue with Claude Code to refine assumptions
3. **Finalize** — Claude writes the detailed specification

## Why It Matters

Building without a specification is building with hope. Hidden assumptions only reveal themselves during rework.

The SPEC workflow ensures:
- **Precision in intent** before writing code
- **Explicit assumptions** that are challenged early
- **Blueprint clarity** that prevents costly rework

## Getting Started

1. Create a `SPEC.md` file for your next project (minimal draft, 2–5 paragraphs)
2. Share it with Claude Code using the interview prompt from the guide
3. Let the dialogue reveal what you truly need to build

## Time Investment

~30 minutes of structured dialogue. Saves weeks of rework.
